# Goal
Develop a game with react and redux.

I'll aim to make a educational game to teach logic to kids. Its going to be something like [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu) where the player will "program" the ship's movements to surpass obstacles and finish levels.

# Resources
* [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu)
* [React Game Kit](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/react-game-kit)
